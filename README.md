# COVID19-india-analysis

This project is created as to understand the increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases in India.

In this project I have created the Racing Bar Graph for increase in confirm cases of each State in India from January,2020 to May,2020.

Various articles were reffered by me to understand Racing Bar Graph.
